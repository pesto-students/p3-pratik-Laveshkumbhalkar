          <h1>History of Ramtek Nagpur</h1>
          <p>
            There is great history associated with Ramtek Nagpur. The historic
            and the famous Lord Rama’s temple is located in Ramtek. Legend has
            that Ramtek was that particular place where the Hindu deity Rama
            rested while in exile for fourteen years. It is also believed that
            Agastya, the Hindu sage also had his ashram located very near to the
            city of Ramtek. The demons indulged in the process of disrupting the
            religious rites and activities that were performed by the sages and
            they also killed many holy men.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lord Rama could bar to hear this anymore and therefore he took a
            pledge or a vow to alleviate the entire world from the deadly and
            the treacherous activities of the demons. In the local language the
            meaning of ‘Tek’ is vow and hence the utterance Ramtek meaning ‘Vow
            of Ram’. It is also believed that any person, who takes a pledge or
            a vow at this place, is bestowed by the blessings of Gods for the
            fulfillment of his or her vow. The people have been worshiping Lord
            Rama’s ‘padukas’ at this place since centuries.
          </p>

          <p>
            The temple that is found at present in Ramtek is believed to have
            been built by Raghuji Bhonsale, Nagpur’s King, after he emerged
            successful in winning the Deogarh fort at Chindwara. The temple of
            Lord Rama in Ramtek is located atop a hill called Ramgiri Hills.
            Ramtek is also very popular because of its relation with the great
            poet named Kalidasa; Kalidasa is believed to have written Meghdootum
            in the hills of the city. It is said that the beauty of the Ramgiri
            Hill inspired Kalidasa to write this beautiful poem. The former
            Indian Prime Minister Mr. Narsimha Rao took part in the elections
            from the constituency of Ramtek.

          <h1>Why is It famous?</h1>
          <p>
            Ramtek is also famous for its possession of the Jain temple that is
            regarded to be very ancient. This temple also consists of statues of
            the Jain Tirthankara that are also supposed to be ancient. Ramtek
            became very popular after the Digambar Jain Acharya Vidyasagar
            visited Ramtek and then stayed at the place for four months in the
            year 1993, 94, 2008 and 2013.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Digambar Jain stayed at Ramtek on chaturmas that takes place
            during rainy season. It was with Acharya’s inspiration that a very
            huge Jain temple was constructed at Ramtek. There are many miracles
            associated with the Jain statue reported by the Jain disciples at
            the temple and this is the reason why the place is also known as
            Atishayakshetra Ramtekji by the people of Ramtek. Apart from this,
            there is also an engineering college located at Ramtek and its name
