## Memoization ##
“Memoization is an optimization technique where expensive function calls are cached such that the result can be immediately returned the next time the function is called with the same arguments”.

1. Memoizing in simple terms means memorizing or storing in memory. 
2. A memoized function is usually faster because if the function is called subsequently with the previous value(s), then instead of executing the function, we would be fetching the result from the cache.
